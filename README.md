Project Title: Digital Documentation of Forts and Heritage Monuments

Project Description:
The project aimed to leverage emerging technologies for the comprehensive digital documentation of historically significant forts and heritage monuments within the State. This endeavor was motivated by the imperative to preserve and disseminate the rich cultural heritage of the region in an accessible and technologically advanced manner.

My Role:
As a group project, my role from the outset was focused on backend development. I was responsible for establishing a seamless connection between the HTML contact page and the MySQL database using PHP. This encompassed database design, data validation, and implementing security measures to fortify the system. The outcome was an enriched user experience in accessing and safeguarding our cultural heritage.
